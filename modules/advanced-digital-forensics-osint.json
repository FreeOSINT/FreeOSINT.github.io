Canvas fingerprinting captures how a device renders graphics at the pixel level, which varies based on hardware, drivers, and OS. WebGL renderer information reveals specific GPU hardware and driver versions. The installed font list represents a unique combination of user choices and system configuration. Together, these elements create a fingerprint with entropy high enough to uniquely identify a specific device with very high confidence.

In contrast, fuzzy hashing algorithms like ssdeep are specifically designed to measure similarity between files. A 90% similarity score with ssdeep indicates that the files share a substantial amount of their content, despite having different cryptographic hashes.

The document uses fonts that were only released in March 2023\n2. The file's $MFT entry in the NTFS file system shows different sequence numbers for the creation timestamp compared to other timestamps\n3. System volume shadow copies don't contain any versions of the file prior to April 2023\n4. The document's internal thumbnail was created using a software version released in February 2023\n5.

      "explanation": "This scenario presents multiple forensic inconsistencies that collectively indicate deliberate backdating through anti-forensics techniques. The presence of fonts only released in March 2023 creates a hard temporal boundary—the document couldn't have existed in its current form before these fonts were available. The discrepancy in NTFS $MFT sequence numbers is a classic indicator of timestomping, as basic anti-forensics tools often fail to maintain consistency in all file system metadata. The absence of the file in volume shadow copies prior to April 2023 provides filesystem-level evidence that the file didn't exist at the claimed creation date. The document's internal thumbnail created with software from February 2023 and hyperlinks to websites that didn't exist until March 2023 provide additional temporal evidence that contradicts the purported January creation date.
