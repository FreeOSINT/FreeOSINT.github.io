      "content": "<p>Social network analysis (SNA) is a powerful technique used by intelligence professionals to map relationships, identify key influencers, and understand information flow within networks.</p><ul><li><strong>Centrality Measures</strong>: Identify the most influential nodes in a network using degree, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality</li><li><strong>Community Detection</strong>: Identify clusters and subgroups within larger networks</li><li><strong>Structural Analysis</strong>: Analyze network density, diameter, and clustering coefficients</li><li><strong>Temporal Analysis</strong>: Track how networks evolve over time</li></ul><p>Professional analysts use specialized software like Maltego, NodeXL, or Gephi to visualize and analyze complex social networks at scale.</p>"

      "title": "Attribution Techniques",
      "content": "<p>Attribution is the process of identifying the real individuals behind online personas. Intelligence professionals use a combination of techniques:</p><ul><li><strong>Linguistic Analysis</strong>: Identify writing patterns, vocabulary choices, and stylometric features</li><li><strong>Behavioral Patterns</strong>: Analyze posting times, device usage, and interaction patterns</li><li><strong>Cross-Platform Correlation</strong>: Link identities across multiple platforms using common indicators</li><li><strong>Technical Indicators</strong>: Analyze metadata, IP addresses, and other technical traces</li><li><strong>Operational Security Failures</strong>: Identify moments when subjects accidentally reveal identifying information</li></ul><p>These techniques must be applied systematically and with appropriate legal and ethical considerations.</p>"

      "title": "Influence Operation Detection",
      "content": "<p>Intelligence agencies and research teams have developed sophisticated methods to detect coordinated influence operations on social media:</p><ul><li><strong>Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior</strong>: Identify accounts working together to amplify messages</li><li><strong>Bot Detection</strong>: Distinguish automated accounts from genuine human users</li><li><strong>Content Analysis</strong>: Analyze narrative themes, messaging strategies, and propaganda techniques</li><li><strong>Temporal Coordination</strong>: Identify suspicious patterns in posting times and content sharing</li><li><strong>Network Topology</strong>: Analyze unusual network structures that indicate artificial amplification</li></ul><p>These techniques help analysts distinguish organic social media activity from coordinated campaigns designed to manipulate public opinion.</p>"
