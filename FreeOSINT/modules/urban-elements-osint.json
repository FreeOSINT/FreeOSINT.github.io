This combination is particularly characteristic of cities that experienced significant development in the early 20th century but also saw modern construction after WWII. Prague, Budapest, and parts of Vienna fit this profile.\n\nThe presence of outdoor café seating combined with spring foliage and mild-weather clothing suggests the image was taken in spring, likely April or May based on the fresh appearance of the leaves.\n\nI would use Google Street View to search potential cities with yellow trams, focusing on areas known for Art Nouveau architecture. I'd look for the specific intersection configuration and building styles visible in the image.\n\nFor timing verification, I would check historical weather data for the candidate cities to confirm mild conditions during the suspected timeframe.
